# Balatro: Repentance
This is a mod that attempts to somewhat accurately implement items from The Binding of Isaac into Balatro, as jokers.

# THIS MOD IS NOT BALANCED
This mod in no way attempts to be balanced, I just decided to follow along with the stats that the specific item has in Isaac, and mirrored it over to respective variable stats in Balatro.

# Stats Conversions

Tears -> Chips <br/>
Damage -> Mult <br/>
Shot Count -> Hands <br/>
Damage Multiplier -> xMult <br/>
Range -> Hand Size <br/>
Bombs -> Temporary Discards <br/>
Coins -> $ <br/>
Keys -> Temporary Hands

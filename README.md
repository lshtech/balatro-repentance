# Balatro: Repentance
This is a mod that attempts to somewhat accurately implement items from The Binding of Isaac into Balatro, as jokers.

# THIS MOD IS NOT BALANCED
This mod in no way attempts to be balanced, I just decided to follow along with the stats that the specific item has in Isaac, and mirrored it over to respective variable stats in Balatro.

# Stats Conversions

Tears -> Chips <br\>
Damage -> Mult <br\>
Shot Amount -> xChips <br\>
Damage Multiplier -> xMult <br\>
Range -> Hands <br\>
Bombs -> Discards <br\>
Coins -> $ <br\>
